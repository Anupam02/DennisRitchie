Functions definitions can appear in any order, and in one source file or several,
although no function can be split between files.If some source program appears in 
several files, you may have to say more to compile and load it than if it all 
appears in one, but that is an operating system matter, not a language attribute.

int main() , here return type of main() is int , where 0 means successful.
Since main is a function like any other, it may return a value to its caller, which 
is in effect the environmetnt in which the program was executed.
